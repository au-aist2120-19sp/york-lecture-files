# regressions
# "re introducing fixed problems as we introduce
# new functionality or fix additional bugs"

# "regression testing"
#      "UNIT testing" (many)
# automated unit testing
#     "REPEATABLE", "AUTOMATED" tests
# 
# TDD = Test Driven Development
#    Write tests first

# define interface (NOT visual)
#    name
#    parameters
#    output / return
#    error conditions / preconditions, etc.
# With that interface, you can define test-code
# immediately
